# HoN-mmr-mod
Adjustment to the game_lobby.package file to show mmr in the lobbies. This mod is for version 3.9.4 of HoN.

There are multiple ways to enable mods in HoN. the easiest way is described below:
Copy the game_lobby.package file to C:\<your documents>\Heroes of Newerth\game\ui\fe

If you do this for the first time, you probably have to create the 'ui' and 'fe' folder.
NOTE: the <your documents> folder is something like C:\users\<username\documents\ folder and NOT the C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroes of Newerth folder

If you want to disable the mod, just delete/move or rename the file.
